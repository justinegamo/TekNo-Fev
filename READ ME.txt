• Sounds alarm and flashes warning lights

 IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE:
This device is a BACKUP system. Always install proper smoke detectors as 
your main fire protection. Do not rely on this device alone.

WHAT'S IN THE BOX:
- Fire detection system (assembled on breadboard)
- Power adapter (5V, 2A)
- This user manual
- SD card (already installed)
- SIM card slot (insert your own SIM)

================================================================================
                         2. GETTING STARTED
================================================================================

STEP 1: CHOOSE A LOCATION
• Mount on wall or place on stable surface
• Central location in room
• Away from windows and vents
• Within phone signal range

STEP 2: INSERT SIM CARD
1. Turn OFF the system
2. Find the SIM800L module (has antenna)
3. Insert active SIM card with SMS/call capability
4. Make sure SIM PIN is DISABLED

   How to disable PIN:
   - Put SIM in your phone first
   - Go to Settings → Security → SIM Lock
   - Turn OFF PIN lock
   - Then insert into system

STEP 3: CONNECT POWER
1. Plug power adapter into outlet
2. Connect to Arduino
3. Wait 60 seconds for startup

STARTUP SEQUENCE (takes 60 seconds):
• 0-5 sec: Servo motor moves
• 5-15 sec: Speaker beeps
• 15-30 sec: SIM800L connects (watch for blinking light)
• 30-60 sec: Sensors warm up
• After 60 sec: GREEN LED turns ON = Ready!

✓ SYSTEM READY when GREEN LED is solid ON

================================================================================
                            3. HOW TO USE
